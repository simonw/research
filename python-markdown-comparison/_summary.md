Comparing seven prominent Python markdown libraries, cmarkgfm—bindings to GitHub’s C-based CommonMark/GFM parser—proved dramatically faster (10-50x) than pure Python options such as mistune, Python-Markdown, and marko. The benchmark, spanning small to large markdown documents, consistently found cmarkgfm excels in both speed and stability, making it ideal for high-volume or performance-critical applications. However, cmarkgfm trades extensibility and custom output formats for speed, so libraries like mistune (for fast pure Python and custom rendering) or Python-Markdown (for extension-rich configurability) may be preferable for projects prioritizing flexibility or ease of customization. See [cmarkgfm's repository](https://github.com/theacodes/cmarkgfm) and [mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune) for details.

**Key findings:**
- cmarkgfm is 10-50x faster than pure Python markdown libraries, especially for large documents.
- Pure Python options offer greater extensibility, custom output formats, and API access, but at the cost of speed.
- Best library choice depends on project needs: cmarkgfm for raw speed/GFM compatibility, mistune for pure Python speed/customization, Python-Markdown for plugins/extensions.
