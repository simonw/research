Benchmarking the Python bindings for minijinja (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) against Jinja2 (https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) on Python 3.14 and 3.14t measured template render performance using a realistic e-commerce template with inheritance, loops, and ~65KB HTML output. The suite runs 200 iterations per scenario, captures mean/median/std/min/max, and provides reproducible scripts (run_benchmark.sh, benchmark.py) plus matplotlib charts to visualize results. Jinja2 is faster on stock Python 3.14, while minijinja gains more from the free-threaded 3.14t build, indicating minijinja may be better positioned for free-threaded Python even though it’s currently slower in absolute terms. Everything needed to reproduce the 15–20 minute benchmark and view detailed analysis is included in the repository.

- Jinja2 (3.14): 0.990 ms mean vs Minijinja: 1.528 ms mean — Jinja2 ≈ 1.54× faster on 3.14  
- Jinja2 slows ~14% on 3.14t (1.127 ms); Minijinja speeds up ~13% on 3.14t (1.336 ms)  
- Artifacts: JSON results, comparison/distribution/speedup/timeline charts, and BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md with full analysis
