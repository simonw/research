By rewriting cmarkgfm's bindings from CFFI to the Python C API, the project successfully ported GitHub's cmark-gfm Markdown parser to Pyodide. The resulting wheel is fully functional, requires no further building, and supports all GitHub Flavored Markdown features with high performance, thanks to direct C code execution via WebAssembly. Users can integrate the package into Pyodide (see [Pyodide documentation](https://pyodide.org/)) and render robust Markdown—including tables, strikethrough, and task lists—directly in the browser. This port demonstrates a practical technique for bringing other CFFI-based packages to WebAssembly/Pyodide environments.

**Key Findings:**
- All GFM features (tables, strikethrough, smart typography, etc.) work accurately.
- Integration and pytest test suites pass 100%.
- The port uses only Python C API bindings, improving compatibility and speed.
- [Project source & wheel available](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm).
