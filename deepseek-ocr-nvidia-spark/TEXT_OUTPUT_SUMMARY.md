# ✅ Text Output Fixed!

## Problem Solved

The original `result.mmd` file was empty (all whitespace) because the "grounding" prompt focuses on bounding box coordinates, not clean text extraction.

## Solution

Use the **"Free OCR"** prompt for clean, readable text!

## Quick Usage

```bash
# Best text output
python3 run_ocr_best.py test_image.jpeg

# Output saved to:
cat ocr_output/ocr_result.txt
```

## Sample Output

new OpenAI model arrived this month with a glossy livestream, group watch 
parties and a lingering sense of disappointment.

The YouTube comment section was underwhelmed. "I think they are all starting 
to realize this isn't going to change the world like they thought it would," 
wrote one viewer. "I can see it on their faces." But if the casual user was 
unimpressed, the AI model's saving grace may be code.

Coding is generative AI's newest battleground. With big bills to pay, high 
valuations to live up to and a market wobble to erase, the sector needs to 
prove its corporate productivity chops. Coding is loudly promoted as a 
business use case that already works.

For one thing, AI-generated code holds the promise of replacing programmers — 
a profession of very well paid people. For another, the work can be quantified. 
In April, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said that up to 30 per cent 
of the company's code was now being written by AI. Google chief executive 
Sundar Pichai has said the same thing. Salesforce has paused engineering hires 
and Mark Zuckerberg told podcaster Joe Rogan that Meta would use AI as a 
"mid-level engineer" that writes code.
