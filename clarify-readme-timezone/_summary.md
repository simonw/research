Timezone mismatches in the project’s root README.md were identified due to inconsistent git commit author dates—some in UTC, others in US Pacific time—displayed without timezone clarification. The listing was generated by a cog script that extracted dates using `git log`, then formatted them without standardizing to a common timezone, causing confusion across 39 project directories. To resolve this, the README now includes a note stating all times are in UTC, and the cog script was updated to normalize dates to UTC, ensuring consistent and accurate timestamp display. More on [Git’s date formats](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) and [cog automation tool](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/).

**Key Fixes:**
- All commit times in listings are now shown in UTC.
- README explicitly notes the timezone for clarity.
- Script updated to convert and format all dates as UTC.
