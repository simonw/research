A compact demo shows how to run Python scripts inside a WebAssembly sandbox from Node.js using Pyodide: after npm install, launching node server-simple.js executes example-simple.py and writes generated files to the output/ directory. The project demonstrates a minimal server-side integration pattern for Pyodide (https://pyodide.org/) under Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) and is aimed at quick experimentation with sandboxed Python execution. It requires Node.js v16 or later and provides a simple starting point for extending Python-in-WASM workflows in Node applications.

- Executes Python in WebAssembly via Pyodide and writes outputs to output/
- Minimal commands: npm install; node server-simple.js
- Recommended Node.js v16+ for best compatibility
