# Development Notes

- Initialized `h3o-python` project directory.
- Created Rust/Python package scaffolding directories including `src/` and `tests/`.
- Added `Cargo.toml` configured for a `cdylib` using `pyo3` and pulling `h3o` from the upstream Git tag `v0.9.3`.
- Authored `pyproject.toml` to use `maturin` with project metadata and classifiers suitable for publishing wheels.
- Disabled the upstream `std` feature for `h3o` to avoid const-eval requirements that fail on the stable toolchain shipped in this environment.
- Implemented the Rust extension in `src/lib.rs` exposing geospatial helpers like `latlng_to_cell`, `grid_disk`, and conversions between string, integer, and coordinate representations.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to expose the compiled extension as `h3o_python._core` and package Python shim sources from the `python/` directory.
- Added a small Python package shim in `python/h3o_python/__init__.py` to re-export the Rust-backed helpers with documentation.
- Wrote pytest coverage in `tests/test_bindings.py` exercising conversions, neighborhood queries, and numeric routines.
- Drafted a comprehensive `README.md` outlining features, build steps, testing, and usage examples.
- Ran `cargo fmt` to ensure Rust sources follow standard style.
- Installed `maturin` and `pytest` in the working Python environment for building and testing.
- Created a dedicated Python virtual environment (`.venv`) and installed build/test dependencies inside it to satisfy maturin's expectations.
- Adjusted `are_neighbors` to surface `ResolutionMismatch` errors as Python `ValueError`s and re-ran `cargo fmt`.
- Successfully built and installed the extension locally with `maturin develop`.
- Updated the area expectation in the pytest suite to match the exact value returned by `Resolution::area_km2`.
- Executed the pytest suite successfully after installation.
- Removed the cargo `target/` directory to keep the repository free of build artifacts.
- Deleted the compiled extension artifact created by `maturin develop` to keep the source tree portable.
