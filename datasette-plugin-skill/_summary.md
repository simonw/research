Covering every aspect of Datasette plugin development, this project creates a comprehensive skill set for authors—from bootstrapping with cookiecutter to deploying on GitHub and PyPI. It provides precise guides and working code samples for essential plugin hooks like custom SQL functions, authentication, custom views, and output formats. The resource includes an extensive API reference, best practices for configuration, static assets, and templates, plus testing and publishing workflows to ensure reliable plugins. Developers can use this to rapidly build a variety of plugins—custom SQL, visualizations, authentication handlers, data exporters, and more.
