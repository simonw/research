Docker Chrome Neko integrates high-performance WebRTC streaming with the Chrome DevTools Protocol to enable sophisticated remote browser manipulation. Users interact with a containerized Chromium instance through a Next.js control panel that supports real-time navigation, JavaScript injection, and network traffic monitoring. By leveraging the [neko](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko) framework for low-latency video delivery, the project ensures a responsive experience for complex automation and remote exploration tasks. The architecture combines an Express-based agent with persistent script capabilities to provide a robust environment for web testing and data capture via [CDP](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

* WebRTC-powered streaming for low-latency remote interaction.
* Comprehensive API for network traffic capture and responsive viewport management.
* Support for both one-time and persistent JavaScript injection.
* Integrated Next.js dashboard for simplified session control.
