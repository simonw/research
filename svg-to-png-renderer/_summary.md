A lightweight SVG to PNG renderer has been developed using Python, leveraging the `xml.etree.ElementTree` and `Pillow` libraries to parse SVG XML data and convert it to raster PNG images. This minimal library supports a range of SVG elements, including paths, basic shapes, and containers, as well as attributes such as colors, styling, and transforms. The renderer can be used as a command-line tool or imported as a library, and has been tested with complex SVG files, including the "Ghostscript Tiger" SVG. For more information on the project, see the [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) documentation or the [SVG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/).
